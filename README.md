# Orion Combat

## Overview
Orion Combat is a submodule of the main Orion bot farm. It has two main functions; anti-ban and gold-farming. It has been theorized that
training up combat stats and your overall combat level makes your account look more realistic, thus helping to prevent a ban. Also, combat
can be used for gold-farming. Certain monsters have worthwhile loot, making gold-farming possible.
